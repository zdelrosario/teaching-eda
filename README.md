# Overview
This repo collects my materials for teaching short lessons on Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA). I've taught this subject in a variety of ways for diverse
audiences. Thus, there are *many* versions of the material in this repo. The
following links point to the key pieces, and give some suggestions on how you
might use some of these materials.

# The Visual Hierarchy
[This lesson](./viz_tasks/readme.md) introduces basic principles of visualizing
data. It is built around the *visual hierarchy*, introduced by Cleveland and
McGill in 1985. In this lesson, students will:

1. Determine how information is visualized on a graph
2. Use the *visual hierarchy* to rank different visualizations of the same
   information
3. Criticize a graph and suggest improvements
