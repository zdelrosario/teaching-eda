The following is a collaborative analysis of the UCI `autos` dataset.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)

## Data filename
file_name <- "~/Sync/data/autos/imports-85.data"
## Variable names from the UCI site
var_names <-
  c(

}
```

## Wrangling
<!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->

Hadley Wickham says that "importing data is 80% boredom and 20% screaming" --
I've done the screaming here so you don't have to!

The data are essentially in CSV format, though we'll need to do some wrangling.

```{r load_n_wrangle}
df_raw <-
  read_csv(
    file_name,
    col_names = var_names,
    col_types = cols(
      .default = col_number(),
      symboling = col_integer(),
      normalized_losses = col_character(),
      make = col_character(),
      fuel_type = col_character(),
      aspiration = col_character(),
      num_of_doors = col_character(), # Needs manual fix!
      body_style = col_character(),
      drive_wheels = col_character(),
      engine_location = col_character(),
      engine_type = col_character(),
      num_of_cylinders = col_character(), # Also needs manual fix!
      engine_size = col_integer(),
      fuel_system = col_character()
    )
  )
```

The string-coded numbers are obnoxious; let's map those to integers.

```{r}
df_raw %>% pull(num_of_doors) %>% unique()
df_raw %>% pull(num_of_cylinders) %>% unique()
```

Manual fixes for some of the variables.

```{r}
df_autos <-
  df_raw %>%
  mutate(
    num_of_doors = parse_numchar(num_of_doors),
    num_of_cylinders = parse_numchar(num_of_cylinders)
  )
```

Finally, we can analyze the data.

## Correlation not Causation
<!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->

There's an important lesson we need to learn: "Correlation does *not
necessarily* imply causation". This is best done by way of example.

```{r mpg_vs_price}
df_autos %>%
  ggplot(aes(price)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = highway_mpg, color = "Highway"), se = F) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = city_mpg, color = "City"), se = F) +
  geom_point(aes(y = highway_mpg, color = "Highway")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = city_mpg, color = "City")) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar, breaks = c(5e3, 1e4, 2e4, 4e4)) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(10, 20, 40)) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Type") +
  theme_common() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Vehicle Sale Price (1985 USD)",
    y = "Fuel Efficiency (MPG)"
  )
```

It looks like people were paying more for less efficiency in 1985! Is this true?

```{r hp_vs_price}
df_autos %>%
  ggplot(aes(price, horsepower)) +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar, breaks = c(5e3, 1e4, 2e4, 4e4)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_common() +
  labs(
    x = "Vehicle Sale Price (1985 USD)",
    y = "Engine Power (HP)"
  )
```

We can also see that people were paying more for increased horsepower....

```{r mpg_vs_hp}
df_autos %>%
  ggplot(aes(horsepower)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = highway_mpg, color = "Highway"), se = F) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = city_mpg, color = "City"), se = F) +
  geom_point(aes(y = highway_mpg, color = "Highway")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = city_mpg, color = "City")) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    x = "Engine Power (HP)",
    y = "Fuel Efficiency (MPG)"
  ) +
  theme_common() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

... and increased horsepower means decreased fuel efficiency.
