* My questions
- How to do `floating around' well?
- Timing / sequencing?

* 2018-11-30 Test session

** Big picture


** Immediate
- 9th graders don't know about cars!
  + Seconded!
  - Negated!
  + Find more accessible data
- OR Give a picture of the car

- Correlation and causation example good
  + Umbrellas and rain (have a simpler explanation as well)

- "Laying a foundation"
  + Frame the kinds of questions we might like to answer
  + Set the context for wanting to look at data

- Don't call out code you don't emphasize

- Perhaps comment lines you intend to use
- Coding errors can look like incompetence
  + Prime the audience: "You're going to see me mess up here"
  + State norms of the class at the beginning

- "It felt like it was 'black-boxy'"
  + Transitions: e.g. points to boxplots (I've summarized the data)
    - 'Translate' the code into conceptual stuff
  + Code comments maybe?
  + Explain the setup at the beginning
  + Don't jitter the data
  + I didn't follow up on boxplots!!!!!1!!!1
  + Show some dots before jumping to pair plots

- Keep the energy and positivity

- Zoom the text, but not the plots
- Pick better
- Too fast at the beginning
- Too much "guess what I'm thinking"
  + Ask the same question multiple times: "What do you see"? Better chance of
    getting the 'desired' answer?

- Generate data from the students
  + Ask students their height, build a histogram live; gets at 'individual data points'

Handout:
- Summary question
  + Flip Questions 2 & 3
  + Q1 "Wha
  + This section not related to your learning objectives!
    - Maybe just take this out, due to time constraints
    - Maybe keep this for a longer version of the class
  + For NA's, sometimes they're just hard to measure; or errors
- Graphic
  + Modify the viz intro to just support this graphic

- Maybe lose the histograms?
- "I like bad vs good visualizations"

** Other (more accessible) Data
- body measurements dataset?
- countries

** Session 1
- Students only briefly discussed the whiteboard question, then went to sitting
  quietly on their phones
- Students seemed to read the handout in far less than 5 minutes
- I noticed a lot of students raising their hand; I elected to ignore those
  when using LBT
  + Not yet sure what my protocol should be....
- In the Q&A, no students engaged in Live EDA, and instead just asked questions
  about data science
  + This is fine, but it raises a question in my mind on how to transition to a
    more student-driven form of LBT, rather that moving through a set
    curriculum.
- I started about 5 minutes late to wait for stragglers, and ended with about 5
  minutes until the hour

** Session 2
- Students only briefly discussed the whiteboard question, then went to sitting
  quietly on their phones
- I primed the handout with a 2-3 minute expectation, and played it by ear
- Students in the back of the room had a hard time reading the graphs
- I found that the "improve this graph" question was easier for students when I
  phrased it as "suggest two variables to swap" (more scaffolding)
- I got students to buy into the idea of Live EDA by asking for pairs of
  variables; the end of class was rather engaged in the idea

** Session 3
- Students only briefly discussed the whiteboard question, then went to sitting
  quietly on their phones
  + Maybe it's inherently difficult to get younger students (who are strangers)
    to talk to each other?
- The "swap two variables" tweak made the "improve this graph" example run a lot
  smoother
- Students seemed to be engaged with the handout for longer than Session 2....
- I tried "re-asking" questions, or asking questions that basically had the same
  answer as a previously student statement (in LBT mode). Not sure if this is
  irritating to students, but it seems to me a teacher DOF if some students look
  mystified.
- I gave the students the chance to ask questions or call out pairs of
  variables. I only got questions, and we didn't do any Live EDA. (We also had
  to transition to the next class, which probably affected this.)

** General thoughts
- Using LBT for a student-driven experience: I thought LBT worked well for
  working through a set curriculum in an adaptive fashion, but couldn't get
  students to then engage in a student-driven 'Live EDA' as I was planning. It
  seems I'll need more scaffolding if I want to get to a truly student-driven
  LBT session.
