* My questions
- How to do `floating around' well?
- Timing / sequencing?

* 2018-11-30 Test session

** Big picture


** Immediate
- 9th graders don't know about cars!
  + Seconded!
  - Negated!
  + Find more accessible data
- OR Give a picture of the car

- Correlation and causation example good
  + Umbrellas and rain (have a simpler explanation as well)

- "Laying a foundation"
  + Frame the kinds of questions we might like to answer
  + Set the context for wanting to look at data

- Don't call out code you don't emphasize

- Perhaps comment lines you intend to use
- Coding errors can look like incompetence
  + Prime the audience: "You're going to see me mess up here"
  + State norms of the class at the beginning

- "It felt like it was 'black-boxy'"
  + Transitions: e.g. points to boxplots (I've summarized the data)
    - 'Translate' the code into conceptual stuff
  + Code comments maybe?
  + Explain the setup at the beginning
  + Don't jitter the data
  + I didn't follow up on boxplots!!!!!1!!!1
  + Show some dots before jumping to pair plots

- Keep the energy and positivity

- Zoom the text, but not the plots
- Pick better
- Too fast at the beginning
- Too much "guess what I'm thinking"
  + Ask the same question multiple times: "What do you see"? Better chance of
    getting the 'desired' answer?

- Generate data from the students
  + Ask students their height, build a histogram live; gets at 'individual data points'

Handout:
- Summary question
  + Flip Questions 2 & 3
  + Q1 "Wha
  + This section not related to your learning objectives!
    - Maybe just take this out, due to time constraints
    - Maybe keep this for a longer version of the class
  + For NA's, sometimes they're just hard to measure; or errors
- Graphic
  + Modify the viz intro to just support this graphic

- Maybe lose the histograms?
- "I like bad vs good visualizations"

** Other (more accessible) Data
- body measurements dataset?
- countries
