* Learning Goals
1. Students will analyze and improve graphics using the hierarchy of visual
   perception tasks.
2. Students will apply the exploration and questioning phases of EDA.

* Outline
** Overview (5 min)
- "I'd love to meet all of you, but we have limited time."
- "We're going to simulate a lesson from Week 3 of a class."
- "By this point, every student would have a laptop with Rstudio, we would have
  done several small coding assignments, and would have a practical grasp of the
  grammar of graphics."

- *Concept map for EDA class?*

- "First, we're going to study /visualizations themselves/. Then, we're going to
  use graphics to study a dataset."

** Intro to Vis (25 min)
- *Engage* (2 min) Brief intro to the data
  + `diamonds` dataset; counts in each category

- *Explore* (8 min) Interpret and Rank
  + "All of these show the same data in different ways"
  1. Name the variables being shown, describe how they are visualized
  2. Rank the visualizations in terms of how easily you can draw comparisons;
     give your top 3

- *Explain* (10 min)
  + What are the variables? How do they differ?
  + What are your top 3?
    - Cleveland and McGill (1985)

- *Elaborate* (5 min) "Good vs bad vis"
  + "Let's analyze a graph together; how can we improve it?"

** EDA (25 min)
"I don't have time to make you experts in R, but we can get started anyway."

- *Engage* (2 min) Intro to `autos` data
  + `autos` data; we just looked at this

- *Explore* (8 min) Worksheet
  + Static virtual worksheet

- *Explain* (5 min)
  +

- *Elaborate* (8 min)
  + Interactive virtual worksheet

** Wrapup (5 min)
- *Evaluate* (5 min) Takeaways?
  + "What did you learn today?"
