# The Visual Hierarchy
In this activity, students will learn about different ways of encoding
information visually. As Cleveland and McGill[^1] showed with their /visual
hierarchy/, different ways of displaying information lead to more or less
accurate decodings by the reader. Through experiential and discussion-based
learning, students will:

1. Determine how information is visualized on a graph
2. Use the /visual hierarchy/ to rank different visualizations of the same
   information
3. Criticize a graph and suggest improvements

# Lesson Outline

1. (Optional) Depending on the level of your audience, you may want to start
   with a brief introduction to reading graphs. Undergraduates probably do not
   need much of an introduction, but high school students can have highly
   variable experience interpreting graphs.
2. Have students work in groups through the *visual hierarchy* exercise. This is
   available in both [worksheet form](./challenge.md) and as a [set of
   cards](./grid.pdf) to be printed, separated, and sorted by the students. I
   recommend the latter, though the worksheet is an acceptable substitute. The
   [worksheet form](./challenge.md)
