# The Visual Hierarchy
In this activity, students will learn about different ways of encoding
information visually. As Cleveland and McGill[^1] showed with their /visual
hierarchy/, different ways of displaying information lead to more or less
accurate decodings by the reader. Through experiential and discussion-based
learning, students will:

1. Determine how information is visualized on a graph
2. Use the /visual hierarchy/ to rank different visualizations of the same
   information
3. Criticize a graph and suggest improvements

# Lesson Outline

1. (Optional) Depending on the level of your audience, you may want to start
   with a brief introduction to reading graphs. Undergraduates probably do not
   need much of an introduction, but high school students can have highly
   variable experience interpreting graphs. The slides from [SeeMe
   2019](../seeme2019/slides/seeme_slides.html) may provide some ideas on how to
   do this for a high school audience. This section supports Learning Outcome
   (1) above.
2. Have students work in groups through the *visual hierarchy* exercise. This is
   available in both [worksheet form](./challenge.md) and as a [set of
   cards](./grid.pdf) to be printed, separated, and sorted by the students. I
   recommend the latter, though the worksheet is an acceptable substitute. The
   [worksheet form](./challenge.md) contains useful prompts to guide this
   exercise. This section supports Learning Goals (1) and (2) above.
3. Work through the live [Rmarkdown document](../improve_vis/master.Rmd) in a
   group discussion. If the students already have some ability to program in
   Tidyverse `R`, you can assign the `challenge.Rmd` document as an in-class
   assignment. This section supports Learning Goals (2) and (3).
